Example Redhawk Device for GPS that uses Event Messages to publish the gpsinfo structure onto an Event Channel. A *proper* GPS Device would use the GPS IDL, which has its own port type, however I haven't been successful in getting an example of that working... messages work great regardless.

See the ex.simpleGPSNode for an example of how to use it.
